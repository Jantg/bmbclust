Maximum-likelihood Fitting of Univariate Distributions

Description:

Maximum-likelihood fitting of univariate distributions, allowing
parameters to be held fixed if desired.

Usage:

fitdistr(x, densfun, start, ...)

Arguments:

x: A numeric vector of length at least one containing only
finite values.

densfun: Either a character string or a function returning a density
evaluated at its first argument.

Distributions ‘"beta"’, ‘"cauchy"’, ‘"chi-squared"’,
‘"exponential"’, ‘"gamma"’, ‘"geometric"’, ‘"log-normal"’,
‘"lognormal"’, ‘"logistic"’, ‘"negative binomial"’,
‘"normal"’, ‘"Poisson"’, ‘"t"’ and ‘"weibull"’ are
recognised, case being ignored.

start: A named list giving the parameters to be optimized with
initial values. This can be omitted for some of the named
distributions and must be for others (see Details).


Priority
0. New R package for spying paper: compute K_plus/Entropy, vigniette to show reproduce results (inside .Rbuildignore  file).
1. Update_rule part -> make it easier to move to between hier settings
2. Identification (categegorial mixtures) Copositional data -> transformations to bring it to real-space 
3. Plotting of postprocesed results
4. tidying:making more functions to do telescope sampler part shorter
5. Look at how other people implemented summary() part
